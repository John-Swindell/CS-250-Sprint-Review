# Essential Questions Reflection

This section reflects on some of the essential questions encountered throughout the Computer Science program, more specifically, CS-250's Scrum/Agile focused course.

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with active listening, asking clarifying questions, and developing empathy to understand the user's goals and context, not just their explicit requests. It involves analyzing these needs and breaking them down into specific, actionable requirements. Implementing these needs means translating those requirements into functional, tested code and features within the program. User stories are incredibly helpful in this process because they frame requirements from the user's perspective ("As a [user type], I want [action] so that [benefit]"). This keeps the focus on delivering value, facilitates clear communication between stakeholders and developers, helps prioritize work, and provides a basis for defining acceptance criteria to ensure the need is truly met.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach program development with an iterative and incremental mindset. This means starting with core functionality, building it out in small, manageable pieces, testing frequently, and incorporating feedback along the way. Rather than aiming for a perfect final product from the start, the goal is to deliver working software early and often, adapting to changing requirements as needed. In the future, I hope to heavily incorporate Agile processes, particularly Scrum methodologies like working in Sprints (time-boxed iterations), participating in Daily Stand-ups for synchronization, using Sprint Reviews for stakeholder feedback, and engaging in Retrospectives for continuous process improvement. I also see great value in practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration (CI) to enhance code quality and maintainability.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development goes beyond just technical skills. It means being an effective communicator, listening actively, sharing information clearly, and providing constructive feedback respectfully. It involves collaboration, being willing to help others, sharing knowledge, and working together towards common team goals rather than just individual tasks. Reliability and accountability are key; doing what you commit to and taking ownership of your work (including mistakes). Finally, it means being adaptable, open to different perspectives, respectful of diverse skills and opinions within the team, and proactively contributing to a positive and productive team environment focused on collective success.
